  2. The Collectible ID of a Collectible specifies the properties of the Collectible, including the name and description of the Collectible (the &quot; **Collectible Descriptors**&quot;), a URI identifying a file storing a photograph,illustration,image,vector, video,3Dasset,templateasset,orotherpictorialorgraphicwork associated with the Collectible (the &quot; **Collectible Image**&quot;) and potentially other metadata associated with the Collectible (the Collectible Descriptors, Collectible Image and such other metadata, collectively, the &quot; **Collectible Metadata**&quot;).

# License Terms and Specific Restrictions Applicable toCollectible Images

  1. **License to Collectible Image.** For the promises received and given and other good and valuable consideration, including the purchase price, if any, paid for the Collectible, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, theCreator hereby grants to each Collector a licenseto the Collectible Image, upon the following terms and conditions and the other terms and conditions of these Terms:
*    The license is perpetual, fully paid up andworldwide.
*    The license is exclusive to the Collectors and Sublicensees, on the terms set forth in Section 3.4 hereof.
*    The Collector may make personal and non-commercial use of the Collectible Image, solely as part of the Collectible (the &quot; **Personal Use Right&quot;** ). Non-commercial uses are uses that are not promotional, advertorial or involved in merchandising or otherwise commercial.
*    The Collector may sell, transfer, or assign all (but not less than all) of its right, title, and interest in and to the NFT associated with the Collectible (a &quot; **Resale**&quot;), and upon such Resale, all of the Collector&#39;s rights and interests in and to the Collectible, including all of the Collector&#39;s rights and interests in and to the Collectible Image, will be considered sold, transferred, or assigned, as the case may be, to the buyer, transferee, or assignee of such NFT along with the NFT itself (the &quot; **Resale Right**&quot;). The Collector&#39;s rights, title and interest in the Collectible may not be assigned, sold or transferred, in whole or in part, to any person and the Resale Right may not be exercised, in whole or in part, without a sale and transfer of the NFT associated with the Collectible to the assignee, purchaser or transferee, as applicable.
*    The Collector may sublicense the Collector&#39;s Personal Use Rights in the Collectible Image to the lawful operators of websites, the user interfaces of software applications, virtual museums or virtual galleries, or physical museums or physical galleries (if such physical museum or physical gallery solely displays the Collectible Image on a screen while the NFT is held in escrow for such purpose) (&quot; **Sublicensees**&quot;), in each case, for the purposes of: (A) displaying the Collectible Image as part of the Collectible to the public for educational, non-commercial or cultural purposes without any compensation being paid to the Collector; or (B) displaying the Collectible in connection with sale, trading or transfer transactions in the Collectible in accordance with the Resale Right. In each case, the relevant Sublicensee must display the Collectible Image under circumstances reasonably intended to highlight the association of the Collectible Image with the NFT as part of the Collectible. Notwithstanding the otherwise personal and non-commercial nature of the Personal Use Right and the restrictions set forth in Section 4, the use of the Collectible Image by a Sublicensee consistent with the uses stated in this paragraph may have a commercial purpose for the Sublicensee pursuant to its general business of displaying and facilitating trading in images and other information regarding NFT-based art collectibles, promoting such business and collecting fees or commissions in connection with such business.

  2. **Rarible and Other Sublicensees.** Rarible Inc., a Delaware corporation (&quot; **Rarible**&quot;), is hereby automatically deemed to be a Sublicensee of Collector. Any transaction made by the Collector through or with the assistance of any application or software tool of a person eligible to be a Sublicensee and that involves the Collectibles shall automatically be deemed to create an irrevocable, perpetual sublicense of the Collectible Image to such person, and such person shall be deemed to be a Sublicensee. Each Sublicensee shall be an intended third-party beneficiary of these Terms.

  3. **Subrogation**. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Sublicensee shall be subrogated to, and entitled to enforce, seek and receive (but shall have no obligation to enforce, seek or receive): (a) all of the Creator&#39;s rights and remedies against the Collector or any third party to pursue causes of action for copyright or other intellectual property rights infringement relating to the Collectible or pursuant to any provision of Sections 4 through 6 of these Terms; and (b) all of the Collector&#39;s rights and remedies against the Creator pursuant to any provision of Sections 2 through 6 of these Terms. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Collector shall be subrogated to, and entitled to enforce, seek and receive (but shall have no obligation to enforce, seek or receive) all of the Creator&#39;s rights and remedies against any third party to pursue causes of action for copyright or other intellectual property rights infringement relating to the Collectible or pursuant to any provision of Sections 4 through 6 of these Terms. The Creator hereby covenants and agrees to assist each Sublicensee and each Collector with enforcing the rights of the Creator to which the Sublicensee and Creator are subrogated under this Section 3.3, including, without limitation, by joining as a plaintiff in any legal action necessary or desirable for the enforcement of such rights.

  4. **Exclusivity.** The Creator represents and warrants that it has not licensed, and covenants that it will not license, any rights to the Collectible Image except upon these Terms to the lawful possessor of the NFT associated with the Collectible. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if the Collectible was originally offered, sold or transferred by or on behalf of the Creator under circumstances reasonably indicating that the Collectible Image will be included in each of a series of Collectibles associated with a series of NFTs which comply with the ERC-1155 standard (or a similar standard for creating NFTs series), then the Creator represents and warrants that it has not licensed, and covenants that it will not license, any rights to the Collectible Image except upon these Terms to the lawful possessors of the Collectibles (including the associated NFTs) within such series.
